Changes

02/26/01
1. AstaIndyClient changed sendGet to check boolean rather than string.
2. Changed design time RemoteDataSet.Active to NOT wait for authentication
info.

02/27/01
1. compiler directive Asta3mesagePacker.Read for windows Call to SysAllocStringLen

2. added AstaMessagePacker.IsDesignTime method. Server sends back
authentication info on a connect. this can't be used when the client is
design time. if the user is not authenticated on the server nothing comes back
so I don't see this as a problem. probably should raise an exception then.

3. debate as to whether AstaclientWire should be allowed to be active at
design time.

4. Added try/finally to dispose of some R:TReader's in AstaClientRemoteDataSet

3/5/01
1. renamed AstaIo and AstaIndy units to  IO instead of 3
